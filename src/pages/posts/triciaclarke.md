# About Euroart (Media)

I am Trisha Clarke, a producer of the feature film ‘I Shall Be’ which is an international co-production with Tile Films in Dublin, Ireland and Pandora Films in Cologne, Germany. I came into production after a long career as a dancer and actress and then director. I really enjoy the artistic and intellectual challenges that the career of a producer presents, and I like collaborating with other colleagues and travelling to film festivals to advance   our company’s prestige. I was one of the founders of Euroart (Media) Ltd  and we had offices in London before moving to Bath.   

I produced many programmes including the’ City Lives’ TV series that was distributed by Electricsky and sold worldwide to Ireland, Sweden. Spain, Hong Kong and the USA.  Other documentaries we produced included ‘ The Vital Link’ (about interpreting and translating in the modern world), ‘A Celebration of Poetry’, Markus Wolf – In rom the Cold’ and Daniel Libeskind – a Perspective. We undertook many news documentaries both in England and abroad where I found my languages were a great asset.

I  was inspired  to produce ‘I Shall Be’ when the original scriptwriter, Valeria Appel, pitched the story to me, and I could see the dramatic potential. I selected the Irish director. Keith Farrell to direct – he has had much experience directing for BBC TV and independent films.  Keith feels that Regina’s story has to be told as it portrays triumph in the face of impossible odds. She managed to overcome prejudice and achieved her goal in 1936 by becoming the first female rabbi.

We have managed to employ a very good professional crew – the cameraman will be Colm Whelan, the composer will be Rick Wentworth, the set designer will be David Bryan, the costume designer will be Joan Bergin and Patsy Giles will be Head of make-up and hair, I have a marvellous PA called Natasha Montefiore who provides the film with very competent administration and drive.

The film locations we will be using are in Berlin and Leipzig in Germany and in Ireland we will be using Cork and County Wicklow plus Ardmore Studios in Dublin. All post production will be done at Egg Studios run by Gary Shorthall. The production accountant will be James Clarke who will control the E8m budget, half of which is coming from Germany, E1m from Ireland and the remaining E3m will come from British investors.

Keith and I have had a preliminary visit to Berlin to assess the filming options there where we will be employing Roman Kuntz as location manager. David Farrell at Tile Films will be managing the Irish shoot, and Colin Farrell will be the location manager there.  Although we have raised the E8m for the film we do not get this money until the first day of principal photography. However we need money for the script and film development. To take care of these financial needs we are running a kickstarter campaign which is being organised by Ross Carr and Valeria Doddsceppi in the hope that we can raise enough to pay our way to cover these costs.
